### Code portfolio


These are some of the works that I have been doing since I got to university. 
Stock market and Data science are two fields that I am passionate about, and I am willing to pursue them as far as I can. \n

Not only being a customer of TCBS, but I am also very interested in the company's future as well as the application of the data science that 
TCBS has put into practice. I want to be a part of TCBS, and I am willing to spend all of my resources to perform my best at work.
